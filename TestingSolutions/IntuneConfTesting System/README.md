13. **Enrollment Tokens & Certificates** - Apple/Android enrollment tokens with expiration monitoring
14. **Reports and Monitoring** - Access to managed devices and health monitoring

### üé® Enhanced HTML Reporting

The generated report includes:
- **Executive Summary Dashboard** with test statistics
- **Color-coded status indicators:**
  - ‚úÖ Green (Pass) - Meets best practices
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è Yellow (Warning) - Needs attention
  - ‚ùå Red (Fail) - Critical issues
- **Detailed findings per policy** including:
  - ‚úì Strengths - What's configured well
  - ‚ùå Issues - Critical problems requiring attention
  - üí° Recommendations - Optimization opportunities
- **Professional styling** with hover effects and gradient cards
- **Mobile-responsive design**

## Requirements

### PowerShell Modules
The script automatically installs these modules if missing:
- `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication`
- `Microsoft.Graph.DeviceManagement`
- `Microsoft.Graph.DeviceManagement.Enrollment`

### Permissions Required
The following Microsoft Graph scopes are needed:
- `DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementApps.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementManagedDevices.Read.All`
- `DeviceManagementServiceConfig.Read.All`
- `Policy.Read.All` (for Conditional Access analysis)

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```powershell
.\Test-IntuneConfiguration.ps1
```

### Specify Output Path
```powershell
.\Test-IntuneConfiguration.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\Reports"
```

### Connect to Specific Tenant
```powershell
.\Test-IntuneConfiguration.ps1 -TenantId "your-tenant-id"
```

## Output

The script generates an HTML report with filename format:
```
IntuneConfigReport_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html
```

## Interpretation Guide

### Status Meanings

**Pass (‚úÖ)**
- Configuration meets Microsoft best practices
- All critical security settings are properly configured
- Policy is assigned and active

**Warning (‚ö†Ô∏è)**
- Configuration works but has optimization opportunities
- Some best practice recommendations not followed
- Minor security improvements possible
- Policy may not be assigned

**Fail (‚ùå)**
- Critical security issues found
- Multiple best practices violations
- Configuration gaps that need immediate attention

### Common Issues and Recommendations

#### Compliance Policies
- **No BitLocker:** Data at rest is not encrypted
- **Weak passwords:** Passwords under 8 characters
- **No OS version enforcement:** Devices may run outdated/vulnerable OS
- **Antivirus not required:** Devices may be unprotected

#### Configuration Profiles
- **Real-time monitoring disabled:** Threats may not be detected
- **SmartScreen disabled:** Users exposed to malicious downloads
- **Long update deferrals:** Security patches delayed
- **No SSL/TLS for email:** Email traffic not encrypted

## Best Practices for Running Reports

1. **Schedule Regular Reports:** Run monthly or quarterly
2. **Compare Over Time:** Track improvements and regressions
3. **Prioritize Fails:** Address critical issues first
4. **Review Warnings:** Plan improvements for warnings
5. **Document Changes:** Keep reports for compliance auditing
6. **Share with Stakeholders:** Use reports for security reviews
